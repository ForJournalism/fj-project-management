fj-project-management
=====================

This workshop will take participants through the lightweight agile process the Chicago Tribune  News Applications team follows when building news products/projects. After introductions and a  brief discussion of the importance of effective project management, we will provide an overview  of the steps involved in the process, which we will illustrate by walking through a real-world  project the News Apps team built.  

After this overview, participants will split into groups for an exercise. We will provide a  hypothetical request for a newsroom project and will lead the entire group through the early stages together, then divide into our smaller teams to continue the process. We will set up  timed “iterations”; at the end of each of these each team will present its progress in the form of  a faux “iteration review”; groups will take turns acting as stakeholders for one another, in which  capacity they’ll provide feedback to be considered during the next iteration.  

During this exercise, we will move amongst the teams, answering questions, keeping time,  and providing advice as necessary. At the end of the exercise, each team should be ready to  “launch” their project in the form of a sketch and brief explanatory presentation to the whole  group.   Following the group exercise, there will be a Q&A.
